## Setup and Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository (or extract the zip file).**

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ordring-food-app
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Firebase:**
    - Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Enable Firestore Database.
    - Get your Firebase project configuration (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.).
    - Rename `.env.example` to `.env` or directly replace the placeholder values in `src/services/firebase.ts` with your actual Firebase config.
    ```typescript
    // src/services/firebase.ts
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
      projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
      messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
    };
    ```

4.  **Set up Firestore Security Rules:**
    - Go to your Firebase project console -> Firestore Database -> Rules.
    - Copy the content of `firestore.rules` from this project and paste it into the rules editor.
    - Publish the rules.
    - **Note:** The provided rules are basic placeholders and need refinement based on your authentication strategy (e.g., restricting admin actions).

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## Important Notes

- **Incomplete Features:** This project provides the structure and core setup. Many components (`JoinSession`, `SessionPage`, `LiveOrderBoard`, `OrderForm`, `InvoiceEditor`, `PaymentStatus`, etc.) are placeholders and require full implementation of their logic and UI based on the requirements.
- **Firebase Configuration:** Ensure your Firebase config is correctly set up in `src/services/firebase.ts`.
- **Security Rules:** The provided Firestore rules are basic. Implement proper authentication and authorization checks, especially for admin-only actions.
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is included, but more robust error management should be added.
- **Export/Upload:** PDF/CSV export and invoice image upload features are planned but not implemented.
